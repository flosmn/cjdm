            Migrate data from OldFacilityRole to FacilityParty.
            Since revision 698159 (2008-09-23) the entity FacilityRole has been deprecated.
            This service can be used to upgrade existing data from the FacilityRole entity to the new
            FacilityParty entity.
            Before running this service, load the seed data for the RoleType entity from the file:
            party/data/PartyTypeData.xml
