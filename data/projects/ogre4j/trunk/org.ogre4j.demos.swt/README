Summary
-------
ogre4j is a project that enables the use of the OGRE (Object-Oriented
Graphics Rendering Engine) libraries in Java applications. The first
approach was made by Ivica Aracic aka bytelord (http://www.bytelords.de).
Thanks to him for doing the first steps!

The current CVS version located at SourceForge is based on his code but
the new team is working on a complete new version that will be more
powerful (hopefully). To ease the pain for those who are using OGRE in
C++ the usage of ogre4j will be straight forward. Every public interface
of the OGRE library will be available through Java Native Interface (JNI)
in the Java world.

Please go to http://ogre4j.sourceforge.net for more information.


HOW TO use
-----
This example project comes with a few Java dependencies (SWT and vecmath)
but lacks all OGRE stuff as well as 3D data to display.
To run it you have to put all native libraries (SWT, ogre4j, OGRE, OGRE dependencies)
in your working directory and add ogre4j.jar to your classpath.
Furthermore you need some data. It is intended that you put a mesh with all material
scripts in a directory called "media_simple" inside your working directory.
Per default the mesh must be called zuh.mesh, to change this you have to update the code.
