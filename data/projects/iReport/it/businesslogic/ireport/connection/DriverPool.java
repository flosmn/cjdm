/**
 * Utility object for loading and pooling JDBC drivers.
 * <p>
 *  This class was originally embedded into the DatabaseConnection object, it has
 *  been moved out for clarity. The main goal of this class is to provide a few of the 
 *  same functions provided java.sql.DriverManager object but in a way that is better 
 *  suited for the iSQL-Viewer program.
 * <p>
 *  The main shortcoming of the java.sql.DriverManager is that the driver manager
 *  will not allow you to use a registered driver that was loaded with a different
 *  classloader than classloader from the calling class. Basically in short terms
 *  the default DriverManager really only seems to work when all the code and JDBC
 *  drivers are from the same classloader, which doesn't work with the iSQL-Viewer
 *  system since there are runtime and classloader for each ServiceDefinition object.
 * 
 * @see java.sql.DriverManager
