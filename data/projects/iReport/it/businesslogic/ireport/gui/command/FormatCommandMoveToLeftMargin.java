/**
 * Move all elements towards to the left margin over a distance depicted
 * by the distance of the left most element to the left margin
 *
 * From the introduction this command the distance of the first element to the left margin had been taken.
 * This resulted in unwanted behaviour. If the first element was the most right element, then most elements were shifted
 * left of the left margin.
 *
 * Now this is corrected.
