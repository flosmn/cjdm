        <section name="IP Restrictor">
            <p>The IP restrictor allows you to restrict access to your FTP server
               by IP address. Client IP addresses can be allowed or denied access
               according to rules specified.
            </p>
            <p>IP addresses can be specified with wild cards. The following
               special characters may be used.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>*</strong> : A star functions as a wildcard for checking
                    the IP address. Any name or number will match that section of
                    the rule if it is a star.
                </li>
                <li><strong>?</strong> : The question mark '?' character functions as
                    a wildcard for a single character.
                </li>
                <li><strong>[-]</strong> : The hyphen '-' character functions as a range
                    in an IP address.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The order of the rules is important. When a client contacts the
               server, the rules are evaluated from top to bottom in the list
               of rules. The first matching rule applies and evaluation is stopped.
               If there is no match, the client is allowed to access the server.
            </p>
