        <section name="Overview">
            <p>The Apache FTP Server is a 100% pure Java FTP server. We have designed
              it to be a complete and portable ftp server engine solution based on
              currently available open protocols.
            </p>
            <p>It is also a FTP application platform. We have developed a Java API
               to let you write Java code to process FTP event notifications that
               we call the Ftplet API. Apache FTP Server provides an implementation
               of FTP server to support this API.

            <p>Ftpserver is an effort undergoing incubation at the 
               Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator PMC. 
               Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further 
               review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
               making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other 
               successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a 
               reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does 
               indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
